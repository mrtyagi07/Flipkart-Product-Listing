# Flipkart-Product-Listing
This is a prototype of an flipkart product listing page, built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The website has been designed to be responsive, meaning it adapts to different screen sizes and devices, and uses Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework to style the website.

### Logic

The website utilizes the React Context API to handle the state management of the application, allowing for dynamic and efficient updates to the components.

The Context API is a powerful feature of React that allows for a centralized state management solution. It allows the developer to create a global context that can be accessed by any component in the application. This means that the state updates are made in one place, and all the components that are dependent on that state get updated automatically, making the code more dynamic and easy to maintain.

In this, the main logic of the application such as fetching the data from JSON file accordig to user input, is written in the context API. This makes the code more organized, and easy to understand. The developer can easily access the state and update it from any component, without the need to pass props down multiple levels.

The components in this assignment are also well-written, and are designed to be dynamic and reusable. This means that the same component can be used in different parts of the application, with different props passed in, to create different functionality. This makes the code more efficient, as the developer doesn't have to write the same code multiple times, and it also helps to keep the codebase clean and easy to understand.

Overall, the use of React Context API in this allows for efficient and dynamic state management, and the well-written components make the code easy to understand and maintain.
